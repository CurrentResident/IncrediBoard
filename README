You may neither use this code nor create derivatives of it in any manner

At some point in the future, I will revise the license to be permissive and
allow usage and derivation, but that is not today.  I'm not doing this to be
mean, it's just that the software is NOT READY FOR USE, so please don't even
attempt to use it.
